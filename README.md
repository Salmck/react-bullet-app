Bullet journaling running locally in your browser
=================================================

Local todo list with some of the UI vaguely inspired by bullet journaling (see [here](http://bulletjournal.com/)). 
Programmed in react.js (first try at programming using this lib...)


"Installation" guide
====================

Just download the source code, and run index.html in your browser. Alternatively, you can run it straight off github by clicking here.
Everything is stored locally on your computer (using the localStorage ability of html5 apps), no server is required.

A word of caution
=================

1. I'm a crap programmer - don't take this as textbook react or even javascript programming. It just works and to me that's enough...
2. Some features are missing, like the ability to re-order bullets or collections. At the same time it just works for me. I may or may not implement this in the future if I really need it or someone kindly asks :) - alternatively feel free to hack the existing code and send me a pull request (which I will *try* to accept given my limited git abilities)
3. There are a ton of apps that you can use to manage your to-do list. The main difference with this one is that, despite living in your browser, no info is ever sent over the internet about this secret project of yours. Also the UI / approach is slightly different from more complicated apps. Anyways, it suits my professional needs.

Enjoy!
