react-bullet-app
================

Local todo list with some of the UI vaguely inspired by bullet journaling (see [here](http://bulletjournal.com/)). 
Programmed in react.js


Just download the source code, and run index.html in your browser. You can even run it straight of github by clicking here.

Everything is stored locally on your computer (using the localStorage ability of html5 apps), no server is required.
